  <h1>Ree.js</h1>
  <h3>Make Sites Faster, without the need of building anything!</h3>
</div>

A serverless reeactjs framework that teases no-build-step and is serverless-first due to being a static site.
Currently we are developing a sample site along with reejs in this codebase itself in order to showcase the possibilities of this framework. Feel free to report any bugs at the issues section or introduce new ideas in discussions!

Check up the discussions over our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eWbt297SkU) and let us know any suggestions if you have any!

How to test this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rovelstars/reejs ree.js
cd ree.js/reetoolkit
chmod a+x ./script.sh
./script.sh
cd ../docs
reejs serve
```

Should Serve Client Side App, perfect for Serverless environments. Edit `.reecfg` file to suit your needs!
